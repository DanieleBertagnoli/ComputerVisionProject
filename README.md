# Tasks
The project will be composed by the following sub-tasks.

## Face Recognition
Implement a secure and innovative login system that relies on facial recognition technology. Users will be able to access the system by simply presenting their face to the camera. This involves developing a robust face detection and recognition algorithm to authenticate users.
